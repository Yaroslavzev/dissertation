  abstract      = {A typical commercially available magnetoresistive sensor, and particularly an anisotropic magnetoresistive sensor, employs a full bridge of the Wheatstone type formed by two complementary magnetoresistive elements in each branch. This configuration provides linearized response and enlarged sensitivity compared to any other configuration made up of the same elements. Since in a large scale production it is practically impossible to adjust the zero-field resistances of all the four elements to an exactly identical value, there is always some zero-field offset present at the bridge output diagonal even when the sensor is placed in the zero magnetic field. The sensitivity of the sensor, i.e., the ratio of the output voltage change to the change of the measured field H, is associated with the sensitivity of the individual elements. The change of the output voltage is determined by the change of the resistance ΔR of the individual elements. Both the offset and the sensitivity of a full-bridge magnetoresistive sensor is dependent on the zero-field resistances Ri of the elements. However, as in most metallic material, the resistivity of a magnetoresistive element is influenced by temperature. Hence, both the offset and the sensitivity of a real magnetoresistive sensor is temperature dependent. It can be shown that, theoretically speaking, the offset is temperature independent when the bridge is supplied with a constant voltage (but the sensitivity in that case is temperature dependent), and the sensitivity is temperature independent when the bridge is supplied with a constant current (but the offset in that case is temperature dependent). This hypothesis has been verified on KMZ52 sensor (albeit in small temperature range-about 25$\,^{\circ}$C-45$\,^{\circ}$C).},

Studies of pure synthetic, unsubstituted copper tetrahedrite are plagued with difficulties of nonstoichiometry and electron deficiency in its structure. Some tetrahedrite sulfosalts act as semiconductors, while others are metallic compounds, depending on the number of valence electrons and the stoichiometry. We present a first-principles study of the structural, electronic, and optoelectronic properties. In addition to the electron-deficient Cu12Sb4S13 metallic phase, we have analyzed the electronic and optical properties of three Cu-, Sb-, and S-rich compositions with semiconducting properties. The absorption coefficients show that all tetrahedrites have high absorption coefficients because the S, Cu, and Sb states make a larger contribution to the VB- and CB-edge states. },

  abstract = {Quasicrystals have long-range order with symmetries that are incompatible with periodicity, and are often described with reference to a higher-dimensional analogue of a periodic lattice. Within the context of this 'hyperspace' crystallography, lattice dynamics of quasicrystals can be described by a combination of lattice vibrations and atomic fluctuations--phonons and phasons. However, it is difficult to see localized fluctuations in a real-space quasicrystal structure, and so the nature of phason-related fluctuations and their contribution to thermodynamic stability are still not fully understood. Here we use atomic-resolution annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy to map directly the change in thermal diffuse scattering intensity distribution in the quasicrystal, through in situ high-temperature observation of decagonal Al72Ni20Co8. We find that, at 1,100 K, a local anomaly of atomic vibrations becomes significant at specific atomic sites in the structure. The distribution of these localized vibrations is not random but well-correlated, with a quasiperiodic length scale of 2 nm. We are able to explain this feature by an anomalous temperature (Debye-Waller) factor for the Al atoms that sit at the phason-related sites defined within the framework of hyperspace crystallography. The present results therefore provide a direct observation of local thermal vibration anomalies in a solid.},

However, this compound also exists in natural mineral form, and, in fact, is one of the most abundant copper-bearing minerals in the world. We show here that by simply mixing natural mineral tetrahedrite with pure elements through high-energy ball milling without any further heat treatment, we can successfully obtain material with figure of merit near unity at 723 K.},

  abstract = {We have investigated the influence of zinc doping on the thermoelectric properties of CuInTe2-CuGaTe2 solid solution alloys. Undoped end-member compounds display typical p-type semiconducting behavior, with a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity and large Seebeck coefficient. With zinc substituting for indium or gallium, the hole concentration is increased and the electrical transport behavior evolves into that of a degenerate semiconductor, with both electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient increasing with temperature up to the highest temperature measured. For undoped samples the thermoelectric power factor is maximized close to 750 K, while in doped specimens the maximum occurs at much lower temperature. Substitution of gallium for indium induces significant phonon scattering and thermal conductivity reduction below 500 K. The dimensionless figure of merit rises to above unity over a range of compositions in these chalcopyrite compounds, with optimized samples reaching a figure of merit of 1.3.},

  abstract = {The scale up of Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) for the consolidation of large square monoliths (50 [times] 50 [times] 3 mm3) of thermoelectric materials is demonstrated and the properties of the fabricated samples compared with those from laboratory scale SPS. The SPS processing of n-type TiS2 and p-type Cu10.4Ni1.6Sb4S13 produces highly dense compacts of phase pure material. Electrical and thermal transport property measurements reveal that the thermoelectric performance of the consolidated n- and p-type materials is comparable with that of material processed using laboratory scale SPS{\{},{\}} with ZT values that approach 0.75 and 0.35 at 700 K for Cu10.4Ni1.6Sb4S13 and TiS2{\{},{\}} respectively. Mechanical properties of the consolidated materials show that large-scale SPS processing produces highly homogeneous materials with hardness and elastic moduli that deviate little from values obtained on materials processed on the laboratory scale. More generally{\{},{\}} the process described in this paper is a promising way to produce high performance thermoelectric materials with square geometry{\{},{\}} specifically required for thermoelectric device production.},

The existence of localized vibrational modes, which are assigned to the displacements of the trigonally coordinated Cu atoms in the structure, is discussed in the context of anharmonicity and its effect on the low lattice thermal conductivity exhibited by these compounds.},

Mechanical mixtures of Cu2+O and Cu+FeS2 were used to estimate the relative cross sections of Cu2+ and Cu+; the absorption of Cu2+ at 931 eV is 25 times greater than that of Cu+ at 945 eV. Using this calibration, Cu2+/Cu ratios were found to vary from 0.00 to 0.054 in the tetrahedrite samples studied; the highest proportion of Cu2+ occurs in synthetic tetrahedrites with a composition close to Cu12Sb4S13. This study reveals the utility of the technique for determining the valence state of copper in complex minerals, allowing the crystal chemistry to be more fully characterised.},

  abstract = {A technique has been developed to refine the unit-cell parameters of single crystals with minimization of the influence of instrumental errors on the result. The corresponding computational procedure HuberUB is added to the software package of Huber-5042 diffractometer with a point detector and closedcycle helium cryostat Displex DE-202. The parameters of unit cell, its orientation, the goniometer zero angles, the sample eccentricity, the distances in the goniometer, and the radiation wavelength were refined by the nonlinear least-squares method, which allows imposition of constraints on the unit-cell parameters, depending on the crystal symmetry. The technique is approved on a LuB12 single crystal. The unit-cell parameters are determined in a temperature range of 20--295 K, with an absolute error not larger than 0.0004 {\AA} (the relative error is of {\textasciitilde}5 {\texttimes} 10--5). The estimates of the unit-cell parameters obtained by the proposed method are evidenced to be unbiased. Some specific features of the behavior of parameters in the ranges of 120--140 and 20--50 K are revealed, which correlate with the anomalies of the physical properties of the crystal.},

abstract = {Synthetic tetrahedrite, Cu${\sb 12}$Sb${\sb 4}$S${\sb 13}$, obtained by reaction of the elements, has been investigated at various temperatures in the 295{--}573K range. It crystallizes in the cubic system with {\it a} = 10.3293(6){\AA}, {\it V} = 1102.1(2){\AA}${\sp 3}$, space group {\it I}\overline 43{\it m} and {\it Z} = 2 at room temperature. The structure refinement converged to a residue of {\it R} = 0.0165 (at room temperature, {\it wR} = 0.0200) for 389 independent reflections and 34 refined parameters. A Gram{--}Charlier non-harmonic development of the atomic displacement factor for both independent Cu atoms was used. The results show a disorder for the three-coordinated Cu atom, within and perpendicular to the plane of the three surrounding S atoms. However, although the non-harmonic probability density deformation increases with raising the temperature within this plane, it barely changes in the perpendicular direction. This suggests two different types of disorder: static in-plane and dynamic out-of-plane, therefore underlining a possible diffusion pathway for copper ions. To check the significance of the observed effects, the errors for the one-particle potentials and the probability density function maps were calculated by means of a Monte-Carlo method.},

  abstract={Electrical and thermal conductivity and Hall, Seebeck and transverse Nernst-Ettings-hansen effects have been measured over the temperature range from 100°K to 500°K on Cu 3 SbSe 4 . From the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient, the electron to hole mobility ratio is estimated to be about three. Temperature dependences of the resistivity and the Hall coefficient give an estimate of 0.13 eV for the energy gap at 0°K. The infrared transmission spectra at room temperature also showed a threshold of absorption at about 0.11 eV of photon energy. From the Seebeck coefficient data, the effective mass of holes is calculated to be 0.73 m 0 . The scattering parameter is determined to be zero over the temperature range studied which is the value expected for acoustic mode lattice scattering. The lattice thermal conductivity varies with temperature as T -1 . The dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, is evaluated as a function of temperature and the reduced Fermi level.},

abstract  ={Tetrahedrite compounds Cu12-xMnxSb4S13 (0 [less-than-or-equal] x [less-than-or-equal] 1.8) were prepared by solid state synthesis. A detailed crystal structure analysis of Cu10.6Mn1.4Sb4S13 was performed by single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) at 100{,} 200 and 300 K confirming the noncentrosymmetric structure (space group I[4 with combining macron]3m) of a tetrahedrite. The large atomic displacement parameter of the Cu2 atoms was described by splitting the 12e site into a partially and randomly occupied 24g site (Cu22) in addition to the regular 12e site (Cu21){,} suggesting a mix of dynamic and static off-plane Cu2 atom disorder. Rietveld powder XRD pattern and electron probe microanalysis revealed that all the Mn substituted samples showed a single tetrahedrite phase. The electrical resistivity increased with increasing Mn due to substitution of Mn2+ at the Cu1+ site. The positive Seebeck coefficient for all samples indicates that the dominant carriers are holes. Even though the thermal conductivity decreased as a function of increasing Mn{,} the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT decreased{,} because the decrease of the power factor is stronger than the decrease of the thermal conductivity. The maximum ZT = 0.76 at 623 K is obtained for Cu12Sb4S13. The coefficient of thermal expansion 13.5 +/- 0.1 [times] 10-6 K-1 is obtained in the temperature range from 460 K to 670 K for Cu10.2Mn1.8Sb4S13. The Debye temperature{,} [capital Theta]D = 244 K for Cu10.2Mn1.8Sb4S13{,} was estimated from an evaluation of the elastic properties. The effective paramagnetic moment 7.45 [small mu ]B/f.u. for Cu10.2Mn1.8Sb4S13 is fairly consistent with a high spin 3d5 ground state of Mn.}}

Each site in Ca3TaGa3Si2O14 is occupied by atoms of only one type. Nevertheless, its structural feature is asymmetric disordering of sites of Ca, Ta, Ga, and two out of three oxygen atoms occupying special and general sites. A transition of some part of Ca atoms ({\textasciitilde}3{\%}) from 3e sites on the twofold symmetry axis to general 6g sites is revealed.},
